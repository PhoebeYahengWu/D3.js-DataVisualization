          <p id="beginning">Coding allows computer programmers to provide valuable services that make our lives more accessible. For example, Zoom uses programming to ensure the continuity of many schools and companies during the current period of "social distancing". Google uses programming to deliver information and answers to millions of searches and questions on the Internet. Uber used programming to create an app that provides alternative ways of commuting and delivering services. Computer programing has gradually transformed the way we live. But did you know that there have been over 700 notable programming languages since it was first introduced in 1950s? The industry changes so rapidly that almost every year there are a few new languages that programmers develop.

          <!-- <blockquote>According to the 2019 StackOverflow developer survey, JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language for the seventh year in a row.</blockquote> -->
          <p>For aspiring or current programmer, it can be hard to decide which coding language to learn. The pie chart below illustrates which programming language tutorials were searched most often on Google worldwide from April 2019 to April 2020 according to the Popularity of Programming Language Index (PYPL). As noted, Python and Java were nearly half of the total searches (31% and 18%, respectively), followed by JavaScript which accounts for 8%. The rest of the searches (40%) include over 100 less popular languages.</p>

    <p>
      To learn more about developers' interest specifically, the 2019 Stack Overflow survey is another great reference. It ranks the top 10 most popular programming, scripting, and markup languages based on responses from 87,354 developers. As depicted by the graph below, JavaScript is the most popular language for developers favored by over 65% unlike the Google search where Python was most popular. It’s then followed by the markup language, HTML, and the styling language, CSS. The query language, SQL, is the third most popular. In this year’s survey, Python outshined Java, and other langugaes including C#, PHP, C++ and C.

    <p>For developers, another motivating factor to learn a new language might be how in demand the skills are in the job market. The line chart below renders the top programming languages that are in-demand by employers based on worldwide data provided by Indeed which is a search engine for employment. Over the past few years, the demand for Python skills have risen significantly, followed by Java and JavaScript. The demand for JavaScript seems to have soared considerably throughout the last year. Overall, the demand for all five languages listed in the chart showed a rising trend.</p>

    <p>To answer the question, the 3 best programming languages to learn in 2020 based on the charts provided are Python, Java and JavaScript. However, knowing what you want to achieve with the help of a certain language is just as important as learning the language. Each programming language serves a unique purpose. For example, if you want to build dynamic and interactive websites, JavaScript, known as the language of the browser, is definitely the best option, while if you want to process and analyze big data, Python is the go-to language. If you are keen on back-end web development, Java and Python are both great choices.</p>
