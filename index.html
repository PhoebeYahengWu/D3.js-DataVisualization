          <p id="beginning">Programming is one of the essential skills required by many well-paying jobs and it enables people to make a positive impact in many ways, either in their jobs, industry or society by helping with efficiency, accessibility and automation, etc. However, since programming language was introduced, there have been over 700 notable programming languages according to Wikipedia. This is indeed overwhelming for programmers to learn and it’s not even necessary to learn them all. In fact, if one programming language is sufficient to the enabling of the task at hand, there may not be a need for another, and the programmer can just begin mastering that one.

          <!-- <blockquote>According to the 2019 StackOverflow developer survey, JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language for the seventh year in a row.</blockquote> -->
          <p>So, which programming language should you start with? The pie chart below illustrates how often language tutorials are searched on Google worldwide from Apr 2019 to Apr 2020 according to PYPL (PopularitY of Programming Language Index). As illustrated by the chart below, Python and Java were searched much more often than other languages, amounting to nearly half of the total search, followed by JavaScript, C#, PHP, C and C++.</p>

    <p>
      Another great reference is the 2019 Stack Overflow survey which includes the ranking of the top 10 most popular programming, scripting, and markup languages based on 87354 developers’ response. As demonstrated by the graph below, JavaScript is the most popular programming language favored by more than 60% of developers. It’s then followed by the markup language HTML and the styling language CSS. The query language SQL ranks third the most popular. Python this year has outshined Java, C#, PHP, C++ and C in the rank of popularity.

    <p>Also motivating developers to learn a new programming language is to see how in demand the skills are in the job market. The line chart below illustrates the top programming languages that are in-demand with employers based on worldwide data through indeed. Over the past few years, the demand in Python has been rising notably, followed by Java, JavaScript, C++ and C#. Throughout the last year, the demand in JavaScript seems to have soared dramatically. Overall, the demand for all five languages listed in the chart showed a rising trend. </p>

    <p>The industry changes so fast that almost every year there are a few new languages that come out. However, each programming language serves a different purpose. For example, JavaScript can help web developers building dynamic and interactive websites, while Python can help data scientists to process and analyze big data as well as help developers on back-end web development. To answer the question, the top programming languages to learn in 2020 are Python, Java and JavaScript. But that being said, knowing what you want to achieve with the help of the certain language is as important as learning a new programming language. After all, if you master one programming language well and know how to deconstruct problems in a way that computers can understand and execute, learning a second language would be straightforward.</p>
